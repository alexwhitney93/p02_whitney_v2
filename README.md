I started doing 2048 in obective C on the macs in the library, ended up switching late to android so I could work from my laptop and figure out android studio. I looked at various implementations of 2048 on android and found help from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEBL4tkhxXM (and associated source code - https://github.com/adeepak7494/2048-Android-App) and various stackoverflow/forum links to get my app working.

The app is a very simple implementation of the game, aside from the swipe gestures instead of directional buttons. The code is not refactored as nicely like as I would like it to be, but I wanted to get this in for now and perhaps I'll revisit it later to optimize some redundencies. The main activity has a start button which when hit, will call startActivity on an intent that is passed our game class. The game class has the logic behind the game and also handles placing our tiles in the corrects spots on our corresponding xml file. Finally there is a simple results class that will either display a "you win" or "you lose" type message, and provides a button to return to the start screen. A seperate java class was also made to handle the swipe gestures.
